#### Appearance
Phaedra was a tall and severe-looking woman; she might have been beautiful, but a hollowness behind the eyes, a perpetual sneer, and a gaunt face similar to her master’s gave her a pronounced, ghoulish affect.

Like many other [[Red Wizards\|Red Wizards]], she completely lacked hair—even eyebrows and lashes—and what skin was visible outside her voluminous scarlet robes was covered in a twisting, shifting canvas of arcane tattoos.

#### Encountering Phaedra: Temple of Ao
The party only directly encountered Phaedra once, while infiltrating the false [[Locations/Tilverton/Temple of Ao\|Temple of Ao]] in the [[Tilver Valley\|Tilver Valley]]. They came upon her and Earthsea working with a bizarre techno-magical apparatus containing an unstable portal to the [[Locations/Shadowfell and extraplanar/Shadowfell\|Shadowfell]].

Phaedra toyed with the party briefly before [[Player characters/Kadarr\|Kadarr]] drew the [[Black Blade\|Black Blade]], decapitating both Earthsea and [[8U8A\|8U8A]] in his madness. 

She seized up Earthsea’s head and bolted for a teleportation circle, closing the ethereal door behind her.

#### Death and beyond in the Shadowfell
Phaedra’s remains were later found in the [[Locations/Shadowfell and extraplanar/Cloister of the Old Night\|Cloister of the Old Night]] in the Shadowfell. She had been violently torn apart—presumably a victim of the horribly mutated [[NPCs/Averlyn\|Averlyn]].

While trying to *speak with dead*, [[Beldrin\|Beldrin]] set off a devious countermeasure that had survived even her death: her skull burst out of her body, and the party barely had time to dive for cover before it exploded.

Descending into the labs beneath the ruined abbey, they discovered that she had brutally tortured both [[NPCs/Arctus Mursk\|Arctus Mursk]] and the Gondola engineer [[NPCs/Donal Maan\|Donal Maan]], and killed Maan’s captive family.
